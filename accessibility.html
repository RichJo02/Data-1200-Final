            <h2>Filler SubTitle</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Our focus of this website was that it should be usable to most if not all people. We have a clear design that is easy to read. 
                Having said that, during our production and development of coding, we used automated accessibility test to further improve 
                our code. The ones we found most helpful where: <a href="https://www.webaccessibility.com/">webaccessibility.com</a>", 
                <a href="https://audit.deque.com/summary">audit.deque.com</a>, but definitely the most useful was 
                <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://richjo02.github.io/Data-1200-Final/reflection.html">wave.webaim.org</a>. 
                The reason is that it gave us guidelines to what we were doing right and what we were doing wrong. You can see in the 
                information page that the topic of universal design (from data1100) had a lot of people with different challenges, since we 
                started with that page it was easier to define what needed to be done. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A lot of thought went into the choosing the color theme of the website. We needed it to be a bright contrast so those with 
                low vision could clearly tell it apart. We chose colors of the opposite site of the spectrum and checked with the color 
                blindnessâ€™s. we needed colors that could easily be defined and not hard on the eyes in dark room, or those sensitive to 
                burned eyes. We also needed the color to keep the site feeling fresh and stylish. With all those thoughts and through the 
                research we did, we came to the conclusion of a type of bright orange. Orange is a color we chose because it is very friendly 
                towards vision affected illnesses like color blind and bad vision. The buttons in the nav are very large because of old people 
                and people with slow mental function. This will make it easier to use them.
            </p>
            <p>
                We need the website to be accessible by those who are blind. To front that we tested it with a screen reader and added 
                a description text to all photos and icons. This will make it readable for those who are blind, those who require voice 
                to text and all the others affected by it. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The design is really simple and straight forward. This leaves little room for error and makes it impossible to do something 
                that will ruin the website. The design is fresh and clean, with little room for user error. The main page navigation is very 
                easy to understand. There are no fancy graphics or animation. And when I mean no fancy graphics, I mean it, no gradients, 
                no dropshadows, no shadows, no textures, no frames. The colors focus on readability, eye strain, color blindness and so on. 
                The site is a little boring, but it doesn't look dull, because the focus is that everyone can access it to read/hear it.
