            <h2>Transitioning from high school to University</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                The biggest challenge for me transitioning to university is the fact that I knew no one here and we were forced to only work in 
                groups, otherwise the assignments would not be graded. Finding people to work with was not the problem but finding likeminded 
                people is. People who aim for the same grade as you, people who want to put in the work you do and the chemistry between people. 
                Those factors are hard to assess when meeting someone for the first time. When you are distributing the workload to the people 
                in the group, you except them to do it and prioritize it. When they so turn in half ass work that you have to correct, it just 
                adds to your workload. So, when dealing with those types of people it is like working against someone, meaning you could 
                probably do it in shorter time if not for the other person. 
            </p>
            
            <h2>Doing it alone</h2>
            <hr>
            <img alt="Coding Image" src="">
            <p>
                When someone does a sloppy job and you have to fix it is one of the most annoying things. I get that people make mistakes, 
                but you are at an age where you should take responsibility for them yourself. If you don’t know how to do it, it is fine to 
                ask for help but don’t hide that fact, because it will get us nowhere before the deadline.
            </p>
            <p>
                Doing something alone may seem like it is easier, but you have to work your ass off to be able to complete it. You may be
                 able to do things without help, but there are some things that you are just not capable of doing. The thing that you may 
                 think is the easiest, may not be. You may think that you can get through that work, but you will fail because you will not 
                 be able to make the correct judgment of the amount of workload.
            </p>

            <h2>Group workload</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Your workload will also be overfilled if you decide to do everything on your own since then you suddenly must do the work 
                of 5 to 7 people. Meaning that you are at an unfair advantage in terms of time collected you can put in. I am no stranger 
                to losing sleep for school assignments, so I don't want to lose sleep, especially if I already have one or more assignments 
                due soon. If you struggle with a bad group or mentor, maybe it is time to move on and find someone else. You know your value, 
                so find someone who can give you what you need. Just remember to check for references and do your homework before you get 
                involved with a person. If you still think you can find someone else, go back to the previous group or people and talk to 
                them again. You’ve done the right thing and now it is their turn to reciprocate. Be kind and patient. If you find that your 
                potential mentor is only after what they can get out of you, find someone else. This is not going to work for you. Be grateful. 
                Don’t let them get you down. If you are grateful and you keep your nose to the grindstone, you will do better in school.

            <h2>Making mistakes</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                On the first day I made a mistake with one of the assignments. I was trying to put a lot of time into it and I didn't really 
                understand what was wrong with the code, it was a mistake on my behalf. But I decided to look on the bright side of the 
                situation and start from the beginning. In two weeks time I learned how to properly use the language. I did manage to make 
                friends, but i was not so lucky in all subjects. I have found a way to balance my university and my studies. Now I just need 
                to stay motivated to not drop out of my first semester of university. So, the biggest challenge is the fact that I am new, so 
                the challenges are just starting. But I am optimistic, and I believe that I will overcome these challenges and succeed.
